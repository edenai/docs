### Everything in AI Gateway, plus:

#### 1) Team & access management
* **Multi-project workspace** for clean separation across products/environments
* **Roles & permissions** to control who can create keys, change routing, and view costs
* Optional **environment setup** (dev / staging / prod) with dedicated limits

#### 2) Cost control & governance

* **Budgets, quotas, and spend alerts** per project/team
* Usage breakdown by **model / provider / endpoint**
* Policy options like **allow/deny lists** for models or providers (where supported)

#### 3) Advanced monitoring

* Deeper visibility into **latency, error rates, fallbacks, and provider performance**
* Exportable logs/metrics for your internal tools (where supported)
* Health and performance reporting for production operations

#### 4) Priority support

* Faster response times and a direct support channel
* Help with debugging provider issues, routing decisions, and best practices

#### 5) Request custom models/providers

* Add new models/providers on demand (subject to feasibility/availability)
* Guidance on which model fits which task (quality vs cost vs latency)

#### 6) Professional Services (on-demand AI engineer)

When you need more than an API, our Professional Services gives you direct access to an experienced Eden AI engineer (or a small delivery squad) to **design, build, and productionize** your AI capabilities—fast.

**What you get**

* **Dedicated senior AI engineer** as your technical point of contact
* **Delivery plan + clear milestones** (what’s shipped each week, what success looks like)
* **Hands-on implementation** in your stack (or a reference implementation you can adapt)
* **Production hardening**: monitoring, safety controls, reliability, and cost governance
* **Knowledge transfer** so your team can maintain and iterate confidently
