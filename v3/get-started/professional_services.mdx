## Professional Services details 

When you need more than an API, our Professional Services gives you direct access to an experienced Eden AI engineer (or a small delivery squad) to **design, build, and productionize** your AI capabilities—fast.

## 1) Use-case delivery (custom APIs built for your business)

We don’t just advise — we **design and deliver custom AI APIs tailored to your specific business requirements**.
Our engineers work closely with your team to understand your workflows, data, constraints, and success criteria, then build a **production-ready API** that fits directly into your product or internal systems.

**What this typically includes:**

-   A **custom API endpoint** designed around your use case (not a generic template)    
-   Logic tailored to your business rules and edge cases 
-   Model selection and routing optimized for your goals (quality, cost, latency)
-   Prompting and orchestration adapted to your domain vocabulary and data
-   Integration-ready outputs (clean schemas, predictable formats, documented behavior)
    

**Examples of custom APIs we deliver:**

-   A **contract analysis API** that extracts clauses specific to your legal framework
-   A **customer support triage API** tuned to your internal categories and escalation rules
-   A **document processing API** that returns structured fields unique to your workflows
-   A **domain-specific assistant API** trained on your internal knowledge and tone
-   A **classification or scoring API** aligned with your proprietary business logic
    

**What you receive**

-   A fully functional **custom API endpoint**
-   Technical documentation (how to use it, expected inputs/outputs)
-   Configuration inside your AI Gateway (monitoring, limits, routing)
-   A handover so your team can operate and evolve it confidently

> In short: **you describe the business need, we deliver the API that implements it.**

### 2) Model selection, benchmarking & routing strategy

Pick the right models without guesswork.
We’ll help you:

* Define **quality metrics** (accuracy, safety, hallucination tolerance)
* Run **benchmarks** on your real samples (cost/latency/quality)
* Set up **routing rules** (fallbacks, provider failover, cost ceilings)
* Establish a **model lifecycle** (how you upgrade models safely)

**Outputs**

* Benchmark report (recommendations + tradeoffs)
* Routing policy configuration
* Rollout plan (A/B, canary, guardrail thresholds)

---

### 3) Production readiness & reliability hardening

Turn a prototype into something ops teams trust.
We implement:

* **Observability** (latency, errors, token usage, provider health, fallbacks)
* **Rate limits + quotas + spend caps** by project/environment
* **Caching strategies** (where appropriate) to reduce cost and latency
* **Incident playbooks** (what to do when a provider degrades)
* **Regression checks** for prompt/model updates

**Outputs**

* Dashboards/KPIs and alerting recommendations
* Reliability checklist + incident runbook
* Cost controls configured and validated

---

### 4) Safety, compliance, and data controls (optional)

For regulated environments or sensitive data.
Support can include:

* **PII handling** (redaction/masking strategy, logging policies)
* **Data retention guidance** (what is stored, for how long, and why)
* **Security review support** (documentation, architecture notes, DPA/security questionnaires)
* **Access controls** (least-privilege roles, key rotation approach)

**Outputs**

* Security & data-flow documentation (shareable with your compliance team)
* Recommended policies for logging/retention/access


## How we work (simple, transparent)

1. **Discovery (1–2 sessions):** goals, constraints, success metrics, sample data
2. **Design:** architecture + model/routing plan + delivery milestones
3. **Build & iterate:** weekly demos, measurable progress, rapid feedback loops
4. **Launch:** monitoring, budgets, guardrails, and handover
5. **Optimize (optional):** continuous improvement and cost/quality tuning

---

## Engagement options

* **On-demand expert hours** (ideal for reviews, troubleshooting, quick builds)
* **Fixed-scope delivery** (clear outputs, timeline, and acceptance criteria)
* **Ongoing partnership** (monthly retainer for continuous improvements)



## What we’ll ask from you (to move fast)

* A small set of **real examples** (inputs/outputs, edge cases)
* Your target **latency + cost** expectations (even rough)
* One technical owner for weekly feedback and approvals
